            three Finals MVP awards, two scoring titles, 14 All-NBA team selections, <br>
            and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP,<br>
            All-Star game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year. He ranks 7th all-time<br>
            in points scored, 5th in field goals, 13th in rebounds, and 7th in blocks. <br>
